ctivities, which are usually run by vigorous students in univerisities, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. Various activities gain more and more attention among the students nowadays. The factors which contribute to their popularity, I think, can be divided into three main categories: demand on network, desire for understanding different culture and promotion in interdisciplinary. 

For one thing, there is little doubt that the activities held by different organizations or clubs can meet the demand on network for some outgoing students. Students who are willing to make friends are always ready to take part in these kinds of activities. Those interesting things to those active students what flower is to bees. Here is a case about myself. When  I was a first year student, I was addicted with the Electronic Association, which is a small but fantastic group established completely by students. There I always met some unfamiliar classmates, and started to talk with them about the electronics. Finally, I felt in love with a nice girl. Before that, I have no idea about who’ll my girlfriend, or whose boyfirend I’ll be, but the activites held by Electronic Association let us encounter each other. I appreciated this group, as well as their activities.
