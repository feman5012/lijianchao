I think it's necesssary to prohibit people from using phone calls in some places. For example, the calling ring usually disturbs the order of classroom. Another exampe is that it's dangerous to use phone on the airplane. Maybe it interferes with the communication between aircraft and the control tower more or less. In addition, if you are focusing on a meeting, you must be angry with the abrupt ring or a whisper through the phone.
Apart from the above places, there are more and more places examples where using phone is improper.
