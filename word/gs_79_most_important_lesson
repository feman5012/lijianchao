I can't agree any more with that the most important lesson can't be learned in class. First of all, usually we're taught to remember some knowledge without any deep thinking about those knowldge such as where does those knowledge come from, which question can be solved by those knowledge. Compared with the classroom, I think practice is more important. You know practice makes perfect. By practicing we can check out the knowledge what we got from classroom. Maybe we'll find some bug in process, and make a correction. All in all I think the most important lesson definitely can't be learned in class.
