I want to describe Matt Damon as my favorite actor. 
First of all, You know he's the leading actor of the film "The Bourne's Identity". It's my favorite film.
In addition, I get some information about him that he is a drop out student from Havard Univeristy. There are many famous people who has the same experience with Matt Damon such as, Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of facebook.
The last but not the least, I get some information about him that he has a wife and 4 daughters, he usually says he loves his family. I think he's a good hunsband, good father, good actor. 
The aboves are some reasons that I like him so much.
