The most useful book for me is the English dictionary. Firstly many English words have over one meaning, you know it confuses me. The dictionary can help me get over them by offering me a detailed explanation and some examples. And in addition I can also learn how to imply the new words from the examples. For the more, I can learn a lot of knowledge apart from the new words. For instance, it is very likely that dictionary illustrates a specific of animal or plant with a picture. Thus we gain more information from the dictionary.
