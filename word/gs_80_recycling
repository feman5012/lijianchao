I disagree with that school should cut the recycling. First of all, as you know resources on the earth are valuable, we should cherish them instead of wasting them. Cutting the recycling is definitely a wasteful action. And secondly, this wasteful action brings a bad education to the students naturally. Students don't think it's a wasteful behavior because school does it. That's some of the reasons I can't agree with cutting the recycling.
