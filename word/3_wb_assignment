During a period of 4 years from 2006 to 2010, I had been studying at NEAU (Northeast Agricultral University). After 4 year's study, finally I got a bachelor degree in electronic information engineering.  Right after my graduation, I got a job from Sunplus, an IT company which manufactured IC. I had worked at Sunplus for 1 year as an FAE, who is responsible for customer support. In 2011, I quited my job at Sunplus, and joined MTk, another company which also manufactures IC. The reason I quited my previous job is that I wanted to get a higher salary. I have been working for MTK from then on. In 2013, I got a award from MTK because of my excellent job. What I've learned in my job is to analyze the bug, some questions caused by the illogic flow of software or wrong design of hardware, then to fix it, then give feedback to customer.
