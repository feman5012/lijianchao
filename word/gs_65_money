If I unexpectedly receive a large amount of money, I would spend it for practical purposes. First of all, I'll exchange 30 percent of all money to foreign currency such as American dollars. By this way I can retain the value of money. And secondly, I'll spend 20 percent buying some fund. By this way, maybe I can get some little profits. And finally, I'll spend the rest of money, this is to say 50 percent of all money, on running a company. Running a company is one of my great dreams. That's all what I want to do, if I have a lot of money.
