The lecturer claims that the research, which is conducted by a firm to investigate
the efficiency of group system, proposes some adverse arguments against the passage.
In his opinion, compared with what happened in reality, the theory stated in the
passage was somewhat inaccurate.

For one thing, the lecturer says that some free riders will emerge from the group
member. Free rider is a term that describes this situation, when people in the 
group seek to get the benefits of being in a group without contributing to the work.
The existence of the free riders implies that some people who worked hard were not
given recognition they should have gotten. The reading passage, by contrast, didn't
point this emergence out. It is said that the group member were assumed to be
dedicated.

For another, there are some contradicted difference existed between the lecture and
passage. The lecturer points out that the firm found out groups are usually slower
than individuals in decision making. The more time is needed for groups to have meetings,
which are necessary for decision making. Yet, the passage aruges that groups are responsive
than individuals resulting from both the number of people involved as well as their
aggregated resources. This is another place where experience contradicted theory.

Finally, there is little doubt that an excellent leader will orient the group toward
glory, compared with a cumbersome one.
