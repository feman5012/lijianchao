I agree with that there is one year break for the students before entering college. First of all, they can spend this period on studying something interesting without caring the credit. Well apart from studying, students can spend this period on researching the industries on which they want to work in the furture. At the end of this one year break, they usually know that which major is their favorite, then choose the majors that suit them best. All in all, I think one year break is beneficial to students.
