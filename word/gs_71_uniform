I can't agree any more with that students should wear uniform in school. First of all, it looks neat that every students wears the same uniform. And secondly, Both tearchers and guards can distinguish the students from other people by the uniform. It'll bring a more safe environment to the students. At last but not least the uniform can eliminate the gap between the rich students and poor students apparently. That's some of the reasons I think students should wear uniform in school.
