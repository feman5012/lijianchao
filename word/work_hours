The lecturer claims that the new policy, which allows people to work four days 
a week instead of five, will have negative effects for companies as well as 
society. This claim is not in a agreement with that of the reading passage, 
which suggests that such a policy will be beneficial.

For one thing, according to the lecture, a company that allows employees to 
have fewer working hours is likely to hire more people to ensure that it meets
normal levels of productivity. If this occurs, expenses for training and medical
insurance will inevitably rise. The reading passage, by contrast, suggests that
employees who enjoy more leisure time make fewer mistakes and work more efficiently, 
leading to increased profits for the enterprise.

For another, there is sort of difference between the lecture and the reading 
passage which concerns the impact of the policy on the unemployment rate. The
lecturer asserts that for the sake of saving money, employers might raise their
expectations of 4-day employees rather than recruit more people. Consequently,
employees who work 4 days will be forced to finish what they did in 5 days previously,
and no additional jobs will be created.

Finally, the lecturer argues that under the new policy, employees will experience not only
decresed quality of life(as shorter working hours will usually translate into less pay), 
but also fewer chances to be promoted to supervisory positions. However, the reading passage
contends that more leisure hours can create opportunities to strengthen family ties
and allow employees to develop private interests, make them feel more satisfied with 
their lives.
