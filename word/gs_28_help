I have an unforgettable experience regarding my new job. When I felt terrible with my previous job, I talked about this feeling with one of my firends, and asked him for some advice. He said he would try to recommend me to his company. Only what I needed to do is to make a resume, then to be interviewed by their manager. Finally I got this job, What's more fortunate, we're in the same department. I think I'm so lucky to have a firend like this.
