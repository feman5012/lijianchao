The most important decision that I have ever made is to apply for a outside university, when I was 18 years old. At that time, I can choose  universities either inside my hometown or outside my hometown. I choose the outside because I want to expierence a different enviornment from my hometown. And in addition I want to let myself be independant. Right after my graduation, I got a job with an IT company easily. If I were in hometown's university, maybe it was difficult for me to do it without turning to my parents.
