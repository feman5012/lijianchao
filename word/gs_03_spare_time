When I have a leisure time, I usually spend it in the outdoors. Breathe the fresh air, enjoy the nice sunshine.  When in outside, in the help of environment, much of the activities are limitless. Another way to spend spare time is to invite some friends to explore the new part of the city where we live. Sometimes if the time is enough, we'll plan a travel to other place such as the Great Wall. All in all, we can utilize the spare time to relax us, to see something different, to travel to somewhere intresting.
