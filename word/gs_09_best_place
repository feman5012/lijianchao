My favorable place in our city is the Bay Park. It's a big park built along with the Shenzhen Bay. As long as I have some spare time, I would ride my bike to pass through the park, then seat down on the lawn, breathe the fresh air, enjoy the nice sunshine, feel the soft wind flowing from the sea. This type of environment let me relax, that's the reason why I like the Bay Park best.
