The lecturer claims that the painting, which name is "Portrait of an Elderly Woman
in a White Bonnet", is actually painted by Rembrandt. This claim is not in agreement
with that proposed in the reading passage, which argues that Rembrandt was not the 
artist who painted the famous painting.

For one thing, the lecturer explains that the fur collar was apparently painted over
the original painting is used to increas its worth by displaying an aritocratic woman.
Yet the inconsistency between the white caps proposed in the passage, which identifies
the woman as a servant.

For another, the lecturer refutes the viewpoint that light and shadow in the painting do
not fit together by the fact that in the original painting, the woman wears a cloth
that illuminated her face. Thus presentation of light and shadow was indeed very realistic
and accurate, since it is characteristic of Rembrandt's paintings.

Finally, the mystery of the panel consisting of patches glued together is also solved in the
lecture. Actually, the wood panel was later enlarged to make it more grand and valuable,
but the original painting was painted on a single panel, as Rembrandt would have done it.
Furthermore, the wood is of the same tree used in other Rembrandt paintings, like the
"Self-Portrait with a Hat".

All of these information points to Rembrandt as the painter of the controversial painting.
